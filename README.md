My Motivational Story:

After completion of my graduation, I was thinking about what all the companies are trying to do. And I found that most of the companies are delivering services to their clients or products to their customers but the problem here is they are trying to deliver a high-quality standard product. This inspires me that every company needs QA Engineer with desired skills to perform the QA activities to make sure that they are delivering top-quality products. So I have started improving my knowledge and skills on QA and now it's been 4.5 years of experience as a QA Engineer.

Iâ€™m an ISTQB certified software testing engineer with 4.5 years of experience in manual testing, automation testing, and API testing.

And having Java, Javascript, Typescript, and python programming language experience. Some basic knowledge on performance testing with JMeter, AWS, Docker, Linux, etc. I have designed and developed my own automation framework from the scratch.
